Sublime Text 2 editor Snippets for Rastgo Framework.

These snippets are to be updated and new ones to be created as framework is being updated and grown up :) .

- Installation:

Linux Based OS (Ubunut):
Make a folder named RastgoFramework in (~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User/) and copy snippets in it.
You are ready to go Now.

By the way that you can name your folder whatever you want and it does not need to be exactly RastgoFramework in this address: (~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User/).
We named it RastgoFramework so it will be easy to recognize snippets written for rastgo Framework with other ones.
